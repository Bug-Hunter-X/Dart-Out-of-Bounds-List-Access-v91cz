# Dart Out-of-Bounds List Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: accessing a list element with an index that is out of bounds. The code attempts to access an element at index 6 in a list of length 5, resulting in an `RangeError` exception. The solution shows how to prevent this error by checking the index before accessing the list element.
